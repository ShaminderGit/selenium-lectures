1. Absolute Xpath  vs  Relative Xpath
An absolute XPath gives the full path from the root of the HTML document to the
element, while a relative XPath starts from anywhere in the DOM and finds the
element based on its relationship to other nodes. Absolute XPaths are fragile
and break easily if the page structure changes, whereas relative XPaths are shorter,
more flexible, and preferred in Selenium automation

2.• A static dropdown is an HTML element where all the choices are fixed and listed inside  tags within a  tag.
-Example in HTML:
  <select id="country">
    <option value="IN">India</option>
    <option value="US">United States</option>
    <option value="CA">Canada</option>
  </select>
-Here, the dropdown always contains India, United States, Canada unless the page code itself is modified.
- Why “Static”?
    Because the options are hardcoded into the HTML and do not change based on user interaction or backend calls.
    In contrast, a dynamic dropdown fetches or updates options based on user input or server responses.

3.Handling Static Dropdowns in Selenium
Selenium provides a special Select class (from org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select) to interact with static dropdowns:
- Steps:
- Locate the dropdown element using By.id, By.name, etc.
- Create a Select object with that element.
- Use methods like:
- selectByVisibleText("United States")
- selectByValue("US")
- selectByIndex(1)
