Synchronization in Selenium
1. Introduction to Synchronization
- Definition: Synchronization is the technique of aligning Selenium’s execution speed
  with the application’s response time.
- Why it’s needed:
- Web apps often load elements asynchronously (AJAX, JavaScript, API calls).
- Without synchronization, Selenium may throw exceptions like:
- NoSuchElementException
- ElementNotInteractableException
- StaleElementReferenceException
- Goal: Ensure Selenium interacts with elements only when they are ready.
Analogy:
Imagine you’re at a restaurant 🍽️.
You order food, but you can’t eat until it’s served.
Synchronization is Selenium’s way of “waiting for the food to arrive”
before trying to eat.


2. Types of Waits in Selenium
A. Static Wait
- Thread.sleep()
- Hard-coded pause.
- Example:
Thread.sleep(5000); // waits 5 seconds
- Drawbacks:
- Wastes time if element loads faster.
- Fails if element takes longer than expected.
- Makes tests brittle and slow.

B. Dynamic Wait
Dynamic waits adjust intelligently based on conditions.
B.1. Implicit Wait
- Definition: Tells WebDriver to wait for a certain time while locating elements. Applies globally.
- Code:
  driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
- Pros:
- Easy to set up.
- Applies to all elements.
- Cons:
- Not condition-based.
- Mixing with explicit waits can cause unpredictable delays.

B.2. Explicit Wait
Explicit waits are condition-based. Selenium waits until a specific condition is true.

Two categories:

a. WebDriverWait
- Definition: A wrapper around FluentWait with simpler syntax.
- Default polling: Every 500ms.
- Code:
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
WebElement loginBtn = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.id("loginBtn")));
- Common ExpectedConditions:
  visibilityOfElementLocated
  elementToBeClickable
  presenceOfElementLocated
  alertIsPresent

b. FluentWait
- Definition: Advanced explicit wait with full customization.
- Features:
- Custom polling frequency.
- Exception handling.
- Flexible conditions.
- Code:
Wait<WebDriver> fluentWait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
    .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20))
    .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
    .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);

WebElement username = fluentWait.until(driver -> driver.findElement(By.id("username")));

Wait<WebDriver> fluentWait = new FluentWait<>(driver)
    .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20))
    .pollingEvery(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
    .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);

WebElement username = fluentWait.until(driver -> driver.findElement(By.id("username")));

 Analogies
- Thread.sleep → Blind waiting (close your eyes for 10 seconds).
- Implicit Wait → “I’ll wait up to 10 seconds, but move as soon as ready.”
- WebDriverWait → Watching specifically for the green light.
- FluentWait → Checking every 2 seconds, ignoring false signals, until truly ready
