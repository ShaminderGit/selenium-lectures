# Selenium Lectures and Hybrid Framework

This repository contains my lecture notes and code examples for **teaching Selenium automation**.  
It is not limited to lectures — it also includes a **hybrid test automation framework** built using the **Page Object Model (POM) pattern**.

---

##  Purpose
- Deliver structured lectures on Selenium automation.  
- Provide clear examples that can be used for **learning, teaching, and interview preparation**.  
- Build a **hybrid framework** that combines lecture content with real-world automation practices.  
- Demonstrate the use of **Page Object Model** for scalable and maintainable test automation.

---

##  How to Use
- Lecture files are stored as `.java` examples for individual concepts.  
- Framework files show how to structure automation projects using **POM**.  
- Compile and run any file using:

```bash
javac LectureFile.java
java LectureFile
